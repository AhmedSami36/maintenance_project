Bug Report:

Title: Duplicated Condition in Reservation Code Block

Description:
The code block provided contains a duplicated condition that leads to incorrect behavior and potential errors. The condition `if (reservation instanceof OverrideReservation)` is redundantly repeated towards the end of the code block, resulting in unnecessary code execution and potentially incorrect attribute values.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute the program with the provided code block.
2. Observe the code behavior and attribute values assigned to the "reservationEl" element.

Expected Results:
The code should correctly assign attribute values based on the type of the "reservation" object, without any duplication or repetition of conditions.

Actual Results:
The condition 'if (reservation instanceof OverrideReservation)' is redundantly repeated towards the end of the code block, potentially resulting in incorrect attribute values and unnecessary code execution.

Additional Information:
The duplication of the condition 'if (reservation instanceof OverrideReservation)' can lead to confusion and maintenance issues. Removing the duplicated condition will ensure cleaner code and avoid potential errors.
